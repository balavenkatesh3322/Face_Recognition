# Face Recognition

## Introduction
We can train our own face using this code. This will detect your face and show your name. For Instance, whenever my face detects in webcam it will show my name in that window.

## Dependencies

Install below the required library in your local machine.

1) python 3.7
2) opencv 4.1.0
3) numpy 
4) face-recognition

## Quick Start
I have used below three python files to solve this issue.

1) **face_generate.py**
 This python file will detect your face and save it in the dataset folder then the new folder will create with your name.
 
2) **face_Train.py**
 This python file will open the dataset folder and take your image from that and train your face K-nearest neighbor algorithm and     face_recognition library.
 
3) **test_face.py**
 This python file will detect your face using the webcam and show your name in that window.
