"""
This is an example of using the k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithm for face recognition.
When should I use this example?
This example is useful when you wish to recognize a large set of known people,
and make a prediction for an unknown person in a feasible computation time.
Algorithm Description:
The knn classifier is first trained on a set of labeled (known) faces and can then predict the person
in an unknown image by finding the k most similar faces (images with closet face-features under eucledian distance)
in its training set, and performing a majority vote (possibly weighted) on their label.
For example, if k=3, and the three closest face images to the given image in the training set are one image of Biden
and two images of Obama, The result would be 'Obama'.
* This implementation uses a weighted vote, such that the votes of closer-neighbors are weighted more heavily.
Usage:
1. Prepare a set of images of the known people you want to recognize. Organize the images in a single directory
   with a sub-directory for each known person.
2. Then, call the 'train' function with the appropriate parameters. Make sure to pass in the 'model_save_path' if you
   want to save the model to disk so you can re-use the model without having to re-train it.
3. Call 'predict' and pass in your trained model to recognize the people in an unknown image.
NOTE: This example requires scikit-learn to be installed! You can install it with pip:
$ pip3 install scikit-learn
